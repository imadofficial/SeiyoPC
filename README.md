# SeiyoPC
A school project based on my mobile-rhythm game Seiyo with similar gameplay but for PC users, written in Python.

## What makes this version different compared to Seiyo Mobile?
This game allows you to experience ALL the charts available in Seiyo today but with a twist designed for computers. All online functionality is available as well along with Cloud Save which allows you to cross-save your scores between all of your devices. **(This feature requires Seiyo to be updated to v1.0 (CS2.3))**

**Latest builds:**
| [Windows 8.1+ (x64)](#) | Linux (x64) | macOS 10.9+ |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

## Required Python libraries to function:
- [PyGame 2.3.0](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
